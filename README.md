# Stock-Premarket-News-Fetcher
I asked ChatGPT to give me steps on how I should build a "Stock-Premarket-News-Fetcher"

Here's what it said:
1. Project Planning and Design:
Define Project Scope: Begin by clearly defining the scope of your project. What are the essential features and functionalities you want to include? Prioritize them.
User Experience (UX) Design: Create wireframes or mockups to design the user interface (UI) of your website. Plan how users will navigate and interact with the stock market data and other features.

2. Technology Stack:
Choose Your Backend: Start by setting up the backend of your website. Choose a .NET framework (e.g., ASP.NET Core) for building web services and handling user authentication.
Select the Frontend Framework: Decide whether you want to use React or Angular for the frontend. Your choice here will influence your development approach.
Database Setup: Create the database structure and design. Define tables for storing user data, stock market data, news articles, and other relevant information.

3. Core Functionality Implementation:
User Registration and Authentication: Implement user registration and login functionality. Ensure that user accounts are securely managed.
Security: Start with essential security measures, such as using HTTPS, hashing passwords, and input validation.
Database Interaction: Develop the backend code for storing and retrieving user data. Set up database connections and API endpoints.

4. Stock Market Data Integration:
Integrate Financial APIs: Choose and integrate with financial data APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) to fetch daily top stock market companies' data.
Data Storage: Implement mechanisms to store and update this data in your database.

5. News Integration:
Web Crawling/News API: Develop or set up web crawlers or integrate news APIs to collect news articles related to the listed companies.
Database Storage: Store the collected news articles in your database.

6. Membership Levels and Ads:
Membership Levels: Implement user membership levels and access control. Define which features or data are accessible to each level.
Ads Integration: Set up ad integration if you plan to monetize your website through advertisements.

7. AI Accuracy Prediction (Optional):
Machine Learning: If you intend to offer AI-based stock predictions, start working on the machine learning models. This is a complex task that involves data collection, model training, and evaluation.

8. Frontend Development:
React/Angular Components: Begin building the frontend components of your website. Create views and user interfaces for users to interact with your data and features.
User Authentication: Implement user registration and login forms on the frontend and connect them to the backend.

9. Testing and Debugging:
Unit Testing: Write unit tests for critical parts of your code to ensure they work as expected.
Integration Testing: Test the interaction between frontend and backend components.
User Testing: Invite a small group of users (or friends) to test your website and provide feedback.

10. Deployment and Hosting:
Deployment: Deploy your website to a web hosting provider or server. Ensure that your server environment is secure.
Database Deployment: Deploy your database to a suitable hosting solution.

11. Documentation:
User Guides: Create user guides and documentation to help users navigate and use your website effectively.
Code Documentation: Ensure that your code is well-documented, including comments and explanations of key functions and components.

12. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools to track website performance, errors, and security.
Maintenance: Be prepared to provide ongoing maintenance, updates, and support.

13. Future Enhancements:
As your project matures, consider adding additional features, improving AI accuracy, or responding to user feedback.
